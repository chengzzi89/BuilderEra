《PaperCutOut》 is a classic cartoon-style material with the theme of folded paper and paper cut. This texture will make the world of Minecraft look as good as a folded carton! In addition to the 3D shadow effect on the texture, there is also paper  Rough.

  The PaperCutOut texture pack was originally created by superalgae and stopped in the java1.11 version.  After missing several versions of this texture and still no update operation, I began to try to take over the creation and optimize this texture pack!
